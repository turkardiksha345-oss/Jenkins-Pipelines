# Jenkins-Pipelines
This project demonstrates the implementation of Jenkins pipelines to automate CI/CD processes, including source code checkout, build, testing, and deployment for applications.

Jenkins

Jenkins is a CI/CD tool that automates software development processes such as code building, testing, integration, and deployment using pipelines.

### Key Features of Jenkins
Open source and free
Supports CI/CD pipelines
Works with Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
Large plugin ecosystem
Supports distributed builds (master & agents)
Integrates with Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure

 ### CI – Continuous Integration :
Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository, and each change is automatically built and tested.

### CD – Continuous Deployment
Code changes are automatically deployed to production without manual approval.

### Pipeline
A pipeline is a series of automated steps that define how code is built, tested, and deployed from start to finish.
A pipeline is an automated process that takes code from source to production through multiple stages like build, test, and deploy.

### Types of Jenkins Pipelines
Declarative Pipeline – Simple and structured (.jdp)
Scripted Pipeline – Flexible and advanced  (.grovy)

### Maven
Apache Maven is a build tool that automates compiling, testing, packaging, and managing dependencies in Java applications using a standard project structure.
